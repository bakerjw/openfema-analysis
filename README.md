# OpenFEMA Data Analysis

## Overview

This [notebook](/get_openfema_data.ipynb) can be used and adapted to work with [**OpenFEMA datasets**](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets) related to the  Individuals and Households Program (IHP). The [python functions](/query.py) within the repository can also be adapted to eventually support other available datasets from OpenFEMA (e.g., disaster information, public assistance).

* **'HousingAssistanceOwners'**: Housing Assistance Program Data - Owners [V2](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/housing-assistance-program-data-owners-v2)
